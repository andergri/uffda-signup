<p>14.	Indemnity</p>
<p>You agree that you will be responsible for your use of the Services, and you agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Uffda and its officers, directors, employees, consultants, affiliates, subsidiaries and agents from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs, arising out of or in any way connected with (i) your access to, use of, or alleged use of the Services; (ii) your violation of these Terms or any representation, warranty, or agreements referenced herein, or any applicable law or regulation; (iii) your violation of any third-party right, including without limitation any intellectual property right, publicity, confidentiality, property or privacy right; or (iv) any disputes or issues between you and any third party. We reserve the right, at our own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you (and without limiting your indemnification obligations with respect to such matter), and in such case, you agree to cooperate with our defense of such claim.</p>
<p>15.	Modifications of these Terms</p>
<p>We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change these Terms on a going-forward basis at any time. Please check these Terms periodically for changes. In the event that a change to these Terms materially modifies your rights or obligations, you will be required to accept such modified terms in order to continue to use the Services. Material modifications are effective upon your acceptance of such the modified Terms. Immaterial modifications are effective upon publication. For the avoidance of doubt, disputes arising under these Terms will be resolved in accordance with these Terms in effect that the time the dispute arose.</p>
<p>16.	Dispute Resolution and Arbitration</p>
<p>a. Generally. In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Uffda in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and Uffda agree that any and all disputes arising in connection with these Terms shall be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. Our agreement to arbitrate disputes includes, but is not limited to all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether the claims arise during or after the termination of these Terms. <span class="caps">YOU</span> <span class="caps">UNDERSTAND</span> <span class="caps">AND</span> <span class="caps">AGREE</span> <span class="caps">THAT</span>, BY <span class="caps">ENTERING</span> <span class="caps">INTO</span> <span class="caps">THESE</span> <span class="caps">TERMS</span>, <span class="caps">YOU</span> <span class="caps">AND</span> <span class="caps">UFFDA</span> <span class="caps">ARE</span> <span class="caps">EACH</span> <span class="caps">WAIVING</span> <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">RIGHT</span> TO A <span class="caps">TRIAL</span> BY <span class="caps">JURY</span> OR TO <span class="caps">PARTICIPATE</span> IN A <span class="caps">CLASS</span> <span class="caps">ACTION</span>.</p>
<p>b. Exceptions. Notwithstanding Subsection a, we both agree that nothing herein will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our right to (i) bring an individual action in small claims court, (ii) pursue enforcement actions through applicable federal, state, or local agencies where such actions are available, (iii) seek injunctive relief in a court of law, or (iv) to file suit in a court of law to address intellectual property infringement claims.</p>
<p>c. Arbitrator. Any arbitration between you and Uffda will be governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, “<span class="caps">AAA</span> Rules”) of the American Arbitration Association (“<span class="caps">AAA</span>”), as modified by these Terms, and will be administered by the <span class="caps">AAA</span>. The <span class="caps">AAA</span> Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the <span class="caps">AAA</span> at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Uffda.</p>
<p>d. Notice; Process. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail or Federal Express (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail (“Notice”). Uffda’s address for Notice is listed in Section 11. The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”). We agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Uffda may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Uffda shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any.  In the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, Uffda shall pay you (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any, (ii) the last written settlement amount offered by Uffda in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator’s award; or (iii) $1,000.00, whichever is greater.</p>
<p>e. Fees. In the event that you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, Uffda will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees shall be decided by the <span class="caps">AAA</span> Rules. Any arbitration hearings will take place at a location to be agreed upon in San Francisco County, California, provided that if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (i) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (ii) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing; or (iii) by an in-person hearing as established by the <span class="caps">AAA</span> Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address.  If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the <span class="caps">AAA</span> Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse Uffda for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the <span class="caps">AAA</span> Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.</p>
<p>f. No Class Actions. <span class="caps">YOU</span> <span class="caps">AND</span> <span class="caps">UFFDA</span> <span class="caps">AGREE</span> <span class="caps">THAT</span> <span class="caps">EACH</span> <span class="caps">MAY</span> <span class="caps">BRING</span> <span class="caps">CLAIMS</span> <span class="caps">AGAINST</span> <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">OTHER</span> <span class="caps">ONLY</span> IN <span class="caps">YOUR</span> OR <span class="caps">ITS</span> <span class="caps">INDIVIDUAL</span> <span class="caps">CAPACITY</span> <span class="caps">AND</span> <span class="caps">NOT</span> AS A <span class="caps">PLAINTIFF</span> OR <span class="caps">CLASS</span> <span class="caps">MEMBER</span> IN <span class="caps">ANY</span> <span class="caps">PURPORTED</span> <span class="caps">CLASS</span> OR <span class="caps">REPRESENTATIVE</span> <span class="caps">PROCEEDING</span>. Further, unless both you and Uffda agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.</p>
<p>g. Modifications. In the event that Uffda makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to Uffda’s address for Notice), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to Uffda’s address for Notice, in which case your account with Uffda shall be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the amendments you reject shall survive.</p>
<p>h. Enforceability. If Subsection f is found to be unenforceable or if the entirety of this Section 16 is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 16 shall be null and void and, in such case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 17.d shall govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms.</p>
<p>17.	Miscellaneous</p>
<p>a. Waiver</p>
<p>Uffda’s failure to require and enforce your compliance with any provision of these Terms does not affect Uffda’s right to require and enforce your compliance with that provision in the future. The failure of Uffda to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision and a waiver of any breach or default of these Terms will not be deemed a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself.</p>
<p>b. Severability</p>
<p>If a court or other administrative body rules that any provision of these Terms is invalid or unenforceable, then that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.</p>
<p>c. Governing Law</p>
<p>These Terms will be governed by the laws of the State of Florida without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>
<p>d. Jurisdiction</p>
<p>To the extent that any lawsuit or court proceeding is permitted under these Terms, you agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal or state courts located in Manatee County, Florida, United States to litigate any disputes with Uffda related to these Terms.</p>
<p>e. Entire Agreement</p>
<p>These Terms, our Privacy Policy, and any other agreements expressly incorporated by reference herein constitute the entire and exclusive agreement between Uffda and you regarding your use of and access to the Services. Except as expressly provided above, these Terms may only be modified with a written agreement executed by both parties. You may not assign or transfer these Terms or your rights hereunder, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent.
